### ðŸ“‚ Custom Adwaita Folder icons [44+]

Originally from [CleoMenezesJr/Custom-Adwaita-Folder-Icons](https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/Custom-Adwaita-Folder-Icons), this fork updates the Icons to the ones used in version 44+ of Nautilus and adds in a few more.

### How to use

So that you don't end up accidentally deleting or moving the file, I recommend cloning the icons to the path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EncryptedEasty/Custom-Adwaita-Folder-Icons.git ~/.local/share/icons
```
These are not mimetypes, that is, when creating a folder that says Games will not automatically place the custom folder of Games. That's not the idea, You choose what you want to put and where you want to put it.
